# Machine Learning Notes

## Analyzing the Problem
* predict something?
* create something?
* reccomend something?

## Data Collection
* a lot of data needs to be collected
* the data needs to be cleaned
* you have to select what you want from that data

## Pick a Model
* what algorithm should you use to solve this problem?
* what algorithm is most appropriate?

## Train the Model
* you need to train the model
* you need to then validate / test the model
* test it's accuracy
* does it make sense? did something?
* then REPEAT keep tweaking and improving until it cant be improved

## Main Steps
* picking the correct algorith
* picking the correct data

## Practice Algorithms
* Linear Regression
* K-Nearest Neighbors
* Support Vector Machines

## Some Directions
* Q Learning (for training video games etc)
* Neural Networks (good for everything kindof)

## Learn your Language
* know the basics of your chosen language
* R is specifically for machine learning
* python is the industry standard
